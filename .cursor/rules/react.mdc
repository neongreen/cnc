When creating a new component, first consider if it's already in shadcn.
If yes, use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>` instead.

For tailwind, you must use `cn` from `@/lib/utils` to merge classes.
Don't use template strings for classes.
It won't work.

Good:

```tsx
className={cn("p-1 m-2 text-accent-foreground", condition ? "bg-red-500" : "bg-blue-500")}
```

Bad:

```tsx
className={`p-1 m-2 text-accent-foreground ${condition ? "bg-red-500" : "bg-blue-500"}`}
```
